# Creating-Continous Deployment Pipeline -using-AWS Services Such as Elastic Beanstalk and CodePipeline 
This project automates the deployment of a web application using **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** and **AWS CodePipeline**. The pipeline fetches the latest code from a **GitHub public repository** and deploys it to Elastic Beanstalk, ensuring a streamlined CI/CD process.

This project demonstrates an automated deployment setup where code from a public GitHub repository is deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using AWS CodePipeline. The process ensures that your application is continuously updated with the latest changes.

## Overview

- **Purpose:** Automate the deployment of a web application using AWS services.
- **Workflow:** Code changes pushed to GitHub trigger AWS CodePipeline, which deploys the new version to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- **Benefit:** Seamless, continuous delivery with minimal manual intervention.


## Tech Stack

- **Cloud Provider:** AWS
- **Deployment Platform:** Elastic Beanstalk
- **CI/CD Automation:** CodePipeline
- **Version Control:** GitHub (public repository.)

## Setup & Deployment

1. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk:**  
   - Initialize your Elastic Beanstalk environment for your web application.
   - Create an environment where your application will run.

2. **AWS CodePipeline:**  
   - Set up a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline.
   - Connect your public GitHub repository as the source.
   - Configure the pipeline to deploy to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

3. **Deployment Process:**  
   - Once configured, any push to your GitHub repository automatically triggers the pipeline.
   - AWS CodePipeline pulls the latest changes and deploys them to Elastic Beanstalk.

## Troubleshooting

- **Deployment Issues:**  
  - Check that all dependencies are correctly listed in your configuration files.
  - Review the AWS Elastic Beanstalk logs for any error messages.
- **Pipeline Failures:**  
  - Ensure your GitHub repository is public and properly linked with CodePipeline.
  - Verify that all AWS permissions and configurations are set up correctly.

## Future Improvements

- Implement zero-downtime deployments with rolling updates.
- Enhance monitoring with AWS CloudWatch to track performance.
- Expand the pipeline to include automated testing before deployment.
